### What is Wolfi and how does it compare to Alpine?

### Is Wolfi free to use?

### Is Wolfi ready for production?

### Can I use Wolfi on a Desktop?
Nope. Wolfi is an un-distro, or distroless

### Who maintains Wolfi?

### Which curated images will you maintain?

### What are the plans for long-term Wolfi governance?

We intend for Wolfi to be a community-driven project, which means over time it will have multi-vendor governance and maintainers. For now we're focused on building the project and community, and will revisit this in several months when a community has formed.
