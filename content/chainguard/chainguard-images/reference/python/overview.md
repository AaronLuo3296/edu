This is a minimal Python image based on Wolfi.

While this image is being developed, we will stick to the latest stable Python version. Supported versions in the long term are TBD.

## Get It!

We have two images available: a `python:latest-dev` variant that contains `pip` and a shell, and a minimal runtime image that just contains
python itself.

These images are available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev
```

## Usage

The python image can be used directly for simple cases, or with a multi-stage build using python-dev as the build container.

```Dockerfile
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --user

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest

WORKDIR /app

# Make sure you update Python version in path
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages

COPY main.py .

ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "/app/main.py" ]
```
